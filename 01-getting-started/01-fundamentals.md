Linux Vs. Windows


| S. No | Linux                                                                                 | Windows                                                        |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Linux is an **open-source** operating system.                                         | Windows is **not open-source**.                                |
| 2     | Linux is **free of cost**.                                                            | Windows is **paid** and requires a license.                    |
| 3     | File names are **case-sensitive** (`file.txt` ≠ `File.txt`).                          | File names are **case-insensitive** (`file.txt` = `File.txt`). |
| 4     | Uses a **monolithic kernel**.                                                         | Uses a **hybrid kernel**.                                      |
| 5     | More **efficient and stable**, especially for servers and developers.                 | Less efficient due to **resource-intensive processes**.        |
| 6     | Uses **forward slash ( / )** for directory separation.                                | Uses **backslash ( \ )** for directory separation.             |
| 7     | More **secure**, with better user control and fewer vulnerabilities.                  | More vulnerable to **malware and viruses**.                    |
| 8     | Preferred by **security experts and ethical hackers** due to flexibility and control. | Not commonly used for hacking; lacks built-in security tools.  |
| 9     | Has **3 user types**: Regular User, Root User, Service Account.                       | Has **4 user types**: Administrator, Standard, Child, Guest.   |
| 10    | **Root user** has all administrative privileges.                                      | **Administrator user** has all administrative privileges.      |
| 11    | Allows files with same name but different case (`File.txt`, `file.txt`).              | Does **not allow** same file names in the same folder.         |

Linux over Windows
Cost-Effectiveness
Free and Open Source: Linux does not require expensive licensing fees, making it a cost-effective choice for companies.
Lower Maintenance Costs: Linux is stable and requires minimal maintenance, reducing operational expenses.
Performance and Efficiency
Better Resource Utilization: Linux is lightweight and consumes fewer system resources compared to Windows.
High Scalability: Linux efficiently scales from small embedded systems to enterprise data centers without performance degradation.
Security and Reliability
Less Vulnerable to Malware: Linux has strong user privilege separation, making it more secure against viruses and malware.
Frequent and Transparent Updates: Regular security patches ensure system stability without requiring frequent reboots.
High Stability: Linux systems can run for years without crashes, ensuring better uptime and reliability.
